## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent energy, focus, and a modern approach to fitness. Derived from concepts of activity, clarity, and trustworthiness, the color departs from typical cliches like green (for nature/health) while still being inviting and optimistic.
- Background color: Light blue (#E5F5FF), a desaturated version of the primary color, for a clean and airy feel that suggests spaciousness for home workouts.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#FF9933) to highlight key interactive elements like buttons and progress indicators, drawing the user's eye.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif for a tech-forward, slightly edgy and modern feel in headings. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif. Space Grotesk is recommended only for short lengths of text, such as headlines. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Clean and modern layout with a focus on easy navigation. Use of whitespace to create a sense of calm and organization. Prioritize clear hierarchy and intuitive placement of elements.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and guide the user through the app, but avoid anything too flashy.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different workout types, settings, and features.
