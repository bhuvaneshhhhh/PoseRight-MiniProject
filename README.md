## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (or npm/yarn)

### Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/poseright-ai.git
    cd poseright-ai
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    To run the AI features, you need a Google AI API key.

    -   Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
    -   Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
    -   Add your API key to the `.env.local` file:
        ```env
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```

### Running the Application

The application consists of two main parts that need to run concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI backend.

1.  **Start the Next.js Frontend:**
    In your terminal, run the following command to start the web application:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
    The app will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Start the Genkit AI Backend:**
    Open a **second terminal window** and run the following command to start the AI service:
    ```bash
    pnpm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This will start the Genkit development server, which automatically reloads when you make changes to your AI flows. The Next.js app communicates with this service for all generative AI features.

    You should now have a fully functional local development environment!
